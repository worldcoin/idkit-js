# IDKit JS

IDKit JS is the new toolkit to interact with the World ID protocol. IDKit can instantly add sybil resistance to your apps by:

-   Receive a signal someone is a unique human (through the Worldcoin orb).
-   Receive a signal someone has a unique phone number (for less sensitive operations).

IDKit and the World ID protocol is fully privacy preserving.

## üöÄ Getting started

Integration is very straightforward. Follow the relevant steps below.

```bash
yarn add idkit
# or
npm install idkit
```

### Lens x Worldcoin

If you're integrating IDKit with a Lens app, check out the Lens-specific docs [here](LENS.md).

### React & Next.js apps

If your app is built on React, using the React widget is by far the easiest approach.

```jsx
import { IDKitWidget } from "@worldcoin/idkit";

<IDKitWidget actionId="get_this_from_the_dev_portal" signal="my_signal" walletconnectId="get_this_from_walletconnect_portal" handleVerify={verifyProof}>
  {({ open }) => (
    {/* You can render whatever you want here, and call open() to open the widget */}
    <button onClick={open}>Click me</button>
  )}
</IDKitWidget>
```

Alternatively, you can render the component without children (on your layout, for example) and use the `useIDKit` hook to open it programmatically.

```jsx
import { useIDKit } from "@worldcoin/idkit";

const { open, setOpen } = useIDKit({
	signal: "my_signal",
	handleVerify: verifyProof,
	actionId: "get_this_from_the_dev_portal",
	walletconnectId: "get_this_from_walletconnect_portal",
});
```

### Generic JS Apps

If your app doesn't have a framework or doesn't use React, continue here.

1. Initialize IDKit (please refer to the docs for further customization details).

```js
IDKit.init({
	signal: "my_signal",
	handleVerify: verifyProof,
	actionId: "get_this_from_the_dev_portal",
	walletconnectId: "get_this_from_walletconnect_portal",
});
```

2. Then, open the widget and await the proof (you can do this in response to a button click, for example).

```js
button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
	IDKit.open();
});
```

## üîí Verifying the IDKit response

IDKit exposes the `handleVerify` option for your app to perform additional verification on the returned response, often a call to an API that ensures the proof is valid.

> **Warning** Make sure you verify the proof, and that you **don't** do it client-side!

Optionally, IDKit also provides an `onSuccess` option, which you can use if your app needs to execute some code after verification succeeds.
