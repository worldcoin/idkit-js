# IDKit JS - React Example

This package contains a very simple example of how to use the World ID JS widget on a React app. The repository was scaffolded using `create-react-app`.

To run this example simply run:

```sh
# make sure to run this in the `/example-react` folder
yarn dev
```

More information about the JS widget can be found [here](../README.md).
